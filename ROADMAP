This text describes the roadmap set out for MinorFs.

0.4
* complete capctkrfs (caretaker fs, a simple caretaker and membrane based filesystem for implementing attenuation and revocation)

0.5
* create caprofs (read only filesystem, a simple wrapper pattern fs for capctkrfs)
* add better and more apparmor profiles.
* add iptables rules.	
* add more tests
* add more documentation

0.6
* create caprocfs (revoke on close), a filesystem that allows a file descriptor close to be used as revokation of a ctkrfs delegated node.

0.7
* create capcowfs (copy on write), a rw filesystem on top of ro nodes where wtitten to files are coppied (in full) at the first writeing action.

0.8
* More tests, lots of testing.
* Documentation of dependencies.
* Packaging for AppArmor based linux distro suse 
* Packaging for AppArmor based ubuntu.

0.9
* anything needed to get MinorFs to work well with and if possible as part of the AppArmor 3.x distribution.

1.0
* Hopefully there will not be a 1.0, if there will be one this means attempts to make MinorFs part of the AppArmor distro failed.
