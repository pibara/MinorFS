To install and use pleas do the folowing:

* Make sure that you have fuse installed, and that the fuse kernel module is 
  loaded at startup. 

* Make sure that you have Fuse.pm installed with a version not lower than 0.09.

* Make sure you have the following perl modules installed
   + Digest::SHA1
   + XML::DOM
   + File::ExtAttr
   + User::pwent
   + Unix::GroupFile 
   + Proc::DaemonLite
   + Unix::Mknod

* Make sure you have the gnu c compiler (gcc) installed.

* As root run the script install.pl

* Start the filesystems by as root invoking:

     /etc/init.d/minorfs start

* Test minorviewfs by (as any user) calling:

     cp /etc/issue /home/minorfs/virtual
     ls /home/minorfs/virtual
     cp /home/minorfs/virtual/issue .
     ls

  This test shows that cp and ls under minorviewfs have distinct
  and private views under /home/minorfs/virtual.

* For testing that minorcapfs and minorviewfs work together, do
  the folowing:

     make test
     ./test

  You should be abel to list the result from ./test, and see how
  minorfs makes use of extended attribute to make private data
  delegatable. 

* If needed, stop minorfs

    /etc/init.d/minorfs stop

Please note, /etc/init.d/minorfs in the current alpha does seem to work from the
commandline, but doesn't seem to work correctly with the runlevel editor,
thus the current version seems to require manual starting and stopping.

If you run into any problems, or discover any bugs (or have any tips on how to get
/etc/init.d/minorfs working with the runlevel editor), please report them
to minorfs@polacanthus.net .
